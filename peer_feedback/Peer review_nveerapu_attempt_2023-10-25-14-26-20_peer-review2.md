Peer Review: Project Proposal 2 (Prediction of Gestational Diabetes)

### What are you trying to do? 

The goal of the team is to predict the occurrence of gestational diabetes in pregnant women. They also aim to address certain preventive measures. They are collaborating with Fetal Life which is a company dedicated to creating a machine learning-driven solution to assist pregnant women. Yes, I understand what the team is trying to accomplish. 
Suggestions: Since they are collaborating with Fetal Life, I believe they may have enough domain knowledge required for this problem. Also, the proposal provides a generalized overview of the goals of the team but I would have liked to see more specifics, like the techniques or approaches they are considering. 

### How is it done today, and what are the limits of the current practice? 

Currently, diagnosis for gestational diabetes occurs in the 20th week of pregnancy. By this time it is already too late. Due to a delayed diagnosis, there are very few intervention options available. 
Yes, the team has convinced me of the need for a system that predicts the occurrence of gestational diabetes early on. 
Suggestion: The team should have provided a quantifiable measure which proves that this indeed is the case. 

### What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful? 

The team plans to utilize various machine learning methodologies to understand factors such as age, socio-economic status, health history and medic-aid claims data in order to identify pregnant women who are at a high risk for developing gestational diabetes. They plan to use this with other indicators such as early weight gain. 
The team mainly plans on using machine learning techniques in order to address the gaps answered in Q2. Yes, the team has convinced me of their approach provided that they obtain the required data. 
Suggestions: Since the team mentioned the usage of medic-aid claims data, where do they plan on obtaining such data since it is supposed to be confidential (are there any HIPAA compliant data sources from where they plan on getting their dataset?)

### Who cares? 

Yes, the team has identified necessary stakeholders. The stakeholders include both fetal life and pregnant women. Being successful in this project would improve the outcomes for pregnant women at a risk for gestational diabetes. 
Suggestions: Two other stakeholders can be healthcare providers and insurance providers. Healthcare providers, since developing such a model can lead to better utilization of resources. It can enable them to provide the required care and assistance and also, take preventive measures if necessary. Insurance providers, since this would influence healthcare costs. 

### What are the risks? 

Yes, the team has identified certain risks. Some of them include the following: 
Data privacy and ethical issues while handling sensitive health data. 
Challenges with the accuracy of predictions from machine learning models. 
Adoption of such a system by healthcare organizations. 
Suggestions: There are other risks associated with such a model and they include, false positives (Since this is a model dealing with the well being of certain people, it is required to be highly accurate), generalization errors (Every pregnancy is different, and so, by using data which encompasses only a certain set of cases, there might be an issue where the model is overfitted and may not perform well on others). Also, another concern is with how balanced the dataset is (This can be mitigated by making sure that there is an equal distribution of positive and negative classes in the dataset). 


Yes, the team has a realistic plan with a timeline depicting the activities to be completed. They have provided a weekly timeline with a set of activities required to be completed each week. They have also identified a coordination plan which involves meeting every week and discussing the progress.
