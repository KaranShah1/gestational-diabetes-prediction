**General Feedback:**

The format and presentation of this proposal are excellent!

1. **Research Question**

   The project aims to focus on the health issues of pregnant women, particularly about gestational diabetes. The importance of this issue they emphasizes makes sense. It would be even better if they could provide supporting data and literature to bolster their opinions. For instance, how many pregrant women face the risk of gestational diabetes.

2. **Current Practice**

   The project mentions that the diagnosis has limited options for intervention, but it requires stronger evidential support. Since they intend to propose a solution, they need to delve deeper into traditional methods to justify their research. Specifically, they should explore what pregnant women and doctors typically do to identify and detect the disease. For instance, a quick search using "gestational diabetes machine learning" as keywords on Google Scholar yielded a plethora of related papers. Therefore, they should review current practices and reconsider the innovative aspects of their approach. An example paper to consider is:
   - Yan Xiong, Lu Lin, Yu Chen, Stephen Salerno, Yi Li, Xiaoxi Zeng & Huafeng Li (2022) "Prediction of gestational diabetes mellitus in the first 19 weeks of pregnancy using machine learning techniques," The Journal of Maternal-Fetal & Neonatal Medicine, 35:13, 2457-2463, DOI: 10.1080/14767058.2020.1786517.


3. **Approach**

   They are using "age, socioeconomic status, health history, and Medicaid claims data" to predict gestational diabetes. These features are generic and can be used to predict any disease. To make the prediction model specific to gestational diabetes in pregnant women, they should consider adding factors like dietary habits, education, pregnancy history, family medical history, etc. They mention using machine learning methods, but it would be helpful if they clarify which specific method they plan to employ and why.

4. **Stakeholder**

   They mentioned pregnant women and fetal life. However, it's important to consider that hospitals (doctors) and insurance companies are also stakeholders. Additionally, it would be beneficial if they could provide more information on the extent to which these stakeholders are concerned or involved in the project.

6. **Risk and Timeline**

   The timeline is quite clear, and their coordination plan is commendable. They are collaborating with a private company. It's important to define the role of this company in the research. There should be clear guidelines to ensure that a profit-oriented company does not misuse the results or interfere with the analysis.

   A significant concern relates to data. They intend to use Kaggle, NIH, or CMS websites to identify their datasets. However, due to the sensitivity of this issue, obtaining detailed individual data might be challenging. Without appropriate data, they cannot specify which features they will use. I suggest that they explore online forums for pregnant women, especially groups related to gestational diabetes. Analyzing posts from these forums can help them identify essential features and potentially lead to innovative insights.
