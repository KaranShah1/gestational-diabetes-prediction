# Project Proposals

George Heilmeier, a former director of the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), formulated these questions to help assess and evaluate research proposals. The Heilmeier Catechism consists of a set of questions that any proposal or new initiative should be able to answer clearly and concisely.

Here are the Heilmeier Catechism questions:

1. **What are you trying to do?** Articulate your objectives using absolutely no jargon.
2. **How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?**
3. **What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?**
4. **Who cares?** If you are successful, what difference will it make?
5. **What are the risks?**
6. **How much will it cost?**
7. **How long will it take?**
8. **What are the midterm and final "exams" to check for success?**

These questions are designed to provide a structured way to think about and present new ideas, ensuring that the essential aspects of the idea are considered and well-understood. They've become a standard tool for many technology managers and researchers when evaluating new projects or proposals.

## Your proposal

When you prepare your project proposals, please address questions 1-5, and consider question 8 to be criteria that you will use to decide whether or not to pivot during your second checkpoint (refer to the syllabus). Also make sure to include the following information:

1. Your answer to question 1 should identify the stakeholder(s) and explain the needs you have identified on behalf of your stakeholders. The stakeholder might or might not "exist" - e.g., the CEO of an imagined tech. company, or a political lobbying firm, or a hospital.  However, you should do all you can to envision the needs of the stakeholder(s) and clarify them in your answer to question 1. 
2. How will you acquire data?  Ideally, you will have already identified a data source and will have verified that it has sufficiently "interesting" data. Data can be interesting for a variety of reasons, including:
    - There's a lot of it (>50000 rows)
    - There are many features (>10 columns)
    - The features covers a variety of different kinds of variables
    - The data addresses an inherently interesting topic.

3. Include a weekly project timeline.  What do you expect to have done at the end of each week?
4. How will you coordinate your work? Have a plan that everyone will contribute do. Avoid plans where individuals work serially, one after the other, as this will inevitably lead to cascading failures. Also include information about how you will coordinate - will there be a weekly check-in?  Or will you communicate on an ad-hoc basis?
