This sounds like a good approach, but is light on the details.  What sorts of ML algorithms are you going to use?  You say you are going to leverage ML technology - well, that's great, but I have a hard time believing no one else has attempted this.  So, what are you going to do specifically that will enable you to succeed where others have not? Moreover, when stating risks, it is not enough to simply state the risk.  You need to explain what you are going to do to ameliorate those risks.  How are you going to deal with sensitive data?  What if your ML approach doesn't work?

I'm also very concerned that you don't have data yet.  I don't know if you've tried to identify data yet, but your second checkpoint is 11/06 - you need to have sufficient data by that point and will have explored your data well enough to have a good approach. If you don't have data identified by next Monday (10/23) you may need to decide on a different project topic.


Grade: 4/5

## Checkpoint 2

**Rubric**
------------------------------------

For the second checkpoint, you will have identified your data and developed a descriptive analysis.  This will be contained in a markdown file called 'checkpoint2_data_analysis.ipynb' that includes:

1. Distributions (where appropriate)
2. Analysis of missing data and outliers
3. Plans for cleaning, including imputation, scaling, encoding, and other feature transformations
4. Any data enrichment you have done or plan to do (e.g., bringing in new datasets)
5. Initial analysis of feature importance (if classification)
6. Observations about corrlelations in the data or other notable statistical features

In addition, your second checkpoint should now specify your refined focus, incorporating feedback and new understandings gleaned from the data.  This part of the submission will be presented in a markdown file called 'checkpoint2_narrative.md.' Explain how you have incorporated feedback from me ( and / or peers).  Additionally, you should now have a revised project plan, and an analysis of how your activities have conformed to your previous plan.

This checkpoint is worth 7 points on your final grade, two of which come from teammates evaluations.  The remaining five points are apportioned as follows:

- 2 points - quality and clarity of data analysis.  Did you address the above points?  Is your submitted notebook well organized and complete?
- 2 points - Insights and clarity of plan moving forward.  Do I understand what you are doing?  Have you addressed points of feedback?  Does your proposed plan take into account the reality of your data?
- 1 point - Do you have a concrete plan moving forward?  Is it realistic?  Does it specify who is doing what?

-----------------------------

I'm a little underwhelmed by this analysis. Your analysis is at best cursory, and you've not really made a ton of progress here - what you've shown reflects maybe a couple of hours of work. I was expecting quite a bit more.  There are grammatical and spelling errors in your submission, and I couldn't identify a well organized notebook.  Your plans for data enrichment are vague, and I'm really not sure whether or not you'll have a nice project at the end of the day here. I'm pretty uncertain about your plan moving forward.

Score: 2.5/5

## Checkpoint 3

5/5

## Checkpoint 4

**Rubric**

1. Project Narrative: Did you follow the guidelines for the case study - e.g. Introduction / Methods / etc., good formatting, good visualizations, convincing writeup.  (5 points)
2. Did your project identify a clear stakeholder and make a significant contribution? (5 points)
3. Quality of data analysis (5 points) - Includes all steps; initial data exploration, appropriate data wrangling, data imputation / encoding, cross-validation, tuning.  

---------

1. 5 / 5 - Excellent writeup 
2. 5 / 5 - nice work here
3. 5 / 5 - Nice work!
